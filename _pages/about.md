British father of 2 boys, who enjoys technology, problem solving and learning.

I've worked in IT roles since graudating and now spend my days as a Solution Architect in Manchester, UK.

As a passionate learner, I wanted to start this site to share what I'm interested in and learning, and if anyone else finds it interesting, then that's great too!
