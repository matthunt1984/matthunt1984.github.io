While drafting, posts should be in _drafts, and jekyll served with --drafts
Can use master or branch. If using drafts master is probably fine

Before posting remember to:
- check it locally
- ensure headings are valid
- spell check
- excerpt on the post (avoid using header)
- Check the TOC too. Starting with the wrong level heading can screw it (I assume it takes the parent height, based on the first heading, so if it sees ### first, it will not show ## headings later)

GitHub workflow
1. Branch. PR, review and just merge (no need to approve)
2. Direct on master (is OK if not long running/save in progress)

Future posts
Can add future posts by simply having the publish date in the filename and leave the date atrribute out. Can review these with the --future when serving

Intermittently check
- More complex elements still work, eg collapsible code blocks
- Test from mobile and other browsers

Short-term actions should go into todo.
Longer term 'never likely to dos' can go here.
- Automated testing including any or all of the above
