Created this note for reminding myself of the intended site structure with additional notes and intent etc

My categories
- tech = All posts related to technology

My tags
- diytech = for doing things your self rather than paid for /commercial services
- <tech-specific> = any tech used will be tagged

tag naming convention = lowercase-hyphenated ?
