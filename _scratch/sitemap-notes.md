Created this note for reminding myself of the intended site structure with additional notes and intent etc

My categories
- tech = All posts related to technology

And what else? Maybe can refine this after some more posts and review.
Could have a blog for generic updates? tech-blog?

My tags
- diytech = for doing things your self rather than paid for /commercial services
- <tech-specific> = any tech used will be tagged

tag naming convention = lowercase-hyphenated ?
